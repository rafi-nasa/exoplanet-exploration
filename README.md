PROJECT - THE EXOPLANET EXPLORATION

Exoplanet discovery is a relatively recent phenomenon, with the earliest confirmed exoplanet dating back to 1992. NASA offers an Exoplanet Archive rich in data, but without easy visualization. This project addresses that gap by overlaying NASA's data onto an image of the Milky Way, allowing users to see the spatial distribution of exoplanets in relation to Earth. 

Users can filter the data by various categories, such as discovery method, year, and facility, revealing new insights. For example, it becomes apparent that exoplanets discovered through microlensing are predominantly located toward the galactic center, have been discovered primarily in recent years, and many of them were identified by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet).
